/**
 * Print, as Markdown, every merge planMerges would make against the committed

 * with their evidence, then the links it refused. With --apply, fold each
 * confident group, and each review group whose surviving slug follows, into
 * its surviving station file; run `npm run stations` afterwards.
 *
 * Usage: npm run report:merges -w packages/stations > merges.md
 *        npm run merge -w packages/stations [-- slug...]
